# CVE-2021-28663
A basic PoC leak for CVE-2021-28663 (Internal of the Android kernel backdoor vulnerability)

This is a basic PoC for CVE-2021-28663. Basicly we create a mapping with alias by MEM_ALLOC+mmap and MEM_ALIAS. With changing flags we can set don't need flag. Changing flags will make pages evictable, but calling a final mmap with the ref of MEM_ALIAS will give us pages for read-only because CPU can only read. This will lead to leak of objects that allocated in the pages that we can access.
